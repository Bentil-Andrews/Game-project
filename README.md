# Game Project (C++)

This is a simple game I created using C++.  
The program runs in the console and allows the user to play by entering inputs from the keyboard.

The main aim of this project was to practice programming and understand how C++ works.

## What the Game Does

- Takes user input
- Uses conditions (if/else)
- Uses loops
- Generates random numbers
- Calculates score
- Saves data using file handling

## How to Run

1. Open the project in a C++ compiler.
2. Compile the main.cpp file.
3. Run the program.

If using g++:

g++ main.cpp -o game
./game

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure a program
- How to use functions
- How to use loops and conditions
- Basic file handling in C++
